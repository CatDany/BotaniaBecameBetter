You are free to compile this mod for yourself, but I don't care if you do something wrong and your OS crashes, computer becomes cursed or you summon Satan accidentally. There are many guides on how to compile a mod out there, I just give you permission ;) Also, would be great if you tell me on Twitter (@Dany2001RU) or somewhere that you're playing with my mod. It's not neccessary, but I'd like to know.
