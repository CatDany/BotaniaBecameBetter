1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1.5
- Added a config option to disable Elven Mana Tablet (now disabled by default)
- Fixed derp: config option that was meant to allow people to disable Unactivated Mana Mob Spawners wasn't working. Now it's renamed, so it's brand new.
- Fixed really small minor mistake in Lexicon localization (wrong color, huh!)

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1.4
- Fixed: Unactivated Mana Mob Spawner was dropping itself after activation with mana
- Redahlia now only breeds one type of animal at a time, so it won't try to breed a sheep with a cow. No artificial selection here, sorry

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1-3
- Added Mana Canvas Bags
- Fixed crash when breaking Unactivated Mana Mob Spawner
- Fixed Mana Tablet tooltip (was always showing as full if had any mana)

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1-2
- Fixed Redalhia mana HUD

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1-1
- Initial build
