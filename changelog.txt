Known Bugs:
- When sharing entries, it shows wrong unlocalized name in chat (e.g. botania.entry.botania.entry.MYENTRYNAME)

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1-16
- Added a little technical feature. Novasteel won't glow if you cheat it with /give @p BotaniaBecameBetter:Novasteel 1 0 {DisableGlow:1}. That way it doesn't look glitched in some GUIs, like HQM book

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1-15
- Fixed: any unblockable damage (e.g. void) wouldn't deal damage to armor nor drain Mana [thanks @Xirenec_ for finding this bug]

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1-14
- Added "Another Gaia Ritual"
- Config option 'deobfReflect' is now deprecated. ReflectionHelper will automatically find correct fields/methods (in theory)

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1-13
- Added fancier crafting for Novasteel, also there's a Lexica Botania entry for that too

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1-12

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1-7

- Added functionality to Novasteel armor
- Added a little easter egg...

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1.5
- Added a config option to disable Elven Mana Tablet (now disabled by default)
- Fixed derp: config option that was meant to allow people to disable Unactivated Mana Mob Spawners wasn't working. Now it's renamed, so it's brand new.
- Fixed really small minor mistake in Lexicon localization (wrong color, huh!)

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1.4
- Fixed: Unactivated Mana Mob Spawner was dropping itself after activation with mana
- Redahlia now only breeds one type of animal at a time, so it won't try to breed a sheep with a cow. No artificial selection here, sorry

1.7.10-ALPHA-0.1-3
- Added Mana Canvas Bags
- Fixed crash when breaking Unactivated Mana Mob Spawner
- Fixed Mana Tablet tooltip (was always showing as full if had any mana)
